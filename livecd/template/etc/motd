You are running the system from the Moon Penguin ISO - as a Live CD. Not
all tools are available within this system, as it only contains
the base tools. Limited networking tools are also available.

The install target location is /mnt. You can mount it yourself
there or chroot into it to perform maintenance and rescue.
